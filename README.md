# Data-Pipeline

A Data Pipeline intaking data from UCI's Iris data set and applying data transformation and feature selection as well as a more appropriate model to maximize acc, precision, recall and f1. This example likely falls into overfitting issues which is due to the training/test split being 8/2 vs 5/5 or 6/4, and not using Cross Validation as well as the feature selection likely being overkill for a data set of this size. 

As a result this is just an example of the concept and likely would struggle on more complex data sets.
